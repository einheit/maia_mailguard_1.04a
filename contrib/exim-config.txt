I’ve just brought the parts salient to using Maia here.

Start by verifying with routers that do nothing but verify alias, mailing lists, etc.
Next pass the mail to a router that can send it to the Maia server

check_system_aliases:
  driver = redirect
  allow_fail
  allow_defer
  data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}
  verify_only
  pass_router = amavis


And here is the amavis router
amavis:
  # Do NOT run if received via 10025/tcp or if already spam-scanned
  # or if bounce message ($sender_address="")
  condition = "${if or {{eq {$interface_port}{10025}} \
        {eq {$received_protocol}{spam-scanned}}\
        {eq {$received_protocol}{local}}\
        {eq {$sender_address}{}} \
        }{0}{1} }"
  transport = amavis
  route_list = "* mailguard.myhost.net byname"
  self = send


And this in my transport definition
amavis:
  driver = smtp
  port = 10024

My Router:

amavis:
driver = manualroute
condition = "${if eq {$interface_port}{10025} {0}{1}}"
condition = "${if eq {$spam_score_int}{}{1}{${if <=
{${spam_score_int}}{00}{0}{1}}}}"
domains = +local_domains
transport = amavis
route_list = "* localhost byname"
self = send
verify_recipient = false


My Transport:

amavis:
driver = smtp
port = 10024
allow_localhost
